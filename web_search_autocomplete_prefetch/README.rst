Prefetch autocomplete offers
============================

When searching, the autocomplete options can be a bit frustrating because you
will be offered choices that won't yield a result. This addon searches for the
term in the background and only offers an option if this search has a result.

Usage

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* some searches (especially via function fields) can be very heavy on the
  server.

  To disable prefetching on a per field basis, set the option
  `web_search_autocomplete_prefetch.disable`::
    options="{'web_search_autocomplete_prefetch.disable': true}"
  on your field in the search view.
