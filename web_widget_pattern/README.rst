==============
Input patterns
==============

This module was written to allow you to define a `regex <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>`_ on character fields a user's input is tested against.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. depend on this module
#. define a key ``pattern`` in the field's options dictionary::

       <field name="email" options="{'pattern': '[\S]+@[\S]+'}" />
#. if you need `pattern modifiers <http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp>`_, use the key ``pattern_modifiers``
