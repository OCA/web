This module was to created to enlarge the *Add a line*
button on Odoo's editable tree view e.g in One2many fields.
Reason for enlarging this button could be for mobile friendliness e.g.
You are a field personnel, and you performing a specific duty on the field on
mobile or tablet and you need to add data. In default odoo, *Add a line*
button is hard to click, thus the need to make it larger and of button size.
