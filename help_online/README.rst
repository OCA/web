Help Online
===========


This module allows the creation of an online help available from the lists
and forms in Odoo.

When loading a view, the module generates a button allowing access to an help
page for the related model if the page exists and the user is member of the
group 'Help reader'. If the page doesn't exist and the user is member of
the group 'Help writer', the module generate a button allowing the creation an
help page.

The help pages are created and managed via the website Module.

Note: When updating the page prefix parameters, the record rules must be
      adapted.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Even if the generated  urls to the documentation contains an anchor (website/hel-xx#view_type),
it's no more possible to insert/edit anchors elements into the website since this functionnality is not supported
by the new html editor in Odoo 10.0 (summernote).
