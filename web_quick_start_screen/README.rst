This module adds a configurable start screen so users can go right into
their more common tasks.

It can be configured at the user level or just be used as common
screens.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Some users use repeatedly the same actions on and on and sometimes those
actions are so many clicks away which tends to be frustrating.

Configuration
=============

To create quick actions:

-  Go to *Settings > Technical > User Interface > Screen actions* and
   create o modify an existing one.
-  Choose the desired action, a name, a description and an icon.
-  You can add an optional context so you can reuse existing actions.
   You can use ``ref(<xml_id>)`` to get an id that you can use in your
   context. You can also use ``datetime`` and ``context_today`` in that
   same way you can do in ``ir.filters``.

To create quick start screens:

-  Go to *Settings > Technical > User Interface > Quick start screens*
   and create or modify an existing one.
-  Choose a descriptive name and link some quick screen actions.

To assign a quick start screen to a user:

-  Go to *Settings > Users and groups > Users* and select one.
-  In the *Preferences* tab, *Menus customization* section, you can
   choose which *Quick start screen* will that user use.
-  If you want to make the user start always in his start screen, in the
   same section select the action *Quick Start Screen*.

To activate the quick start screen menu for a user:

-  Go to *Settings > Users and groups > Users* (with debug mode on)
-  In *Technical* groups, set *Quick Start Screen* on.

Usage
=====

When you have the proper config, once you login, you'll go to the quick
actions screen. Just click in and start working.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Right now there's no much permissions handling, but it could be made
   similarly to how menus deal with them.
-  Also we could add the possibility of quick actions for users the same
   way that favorite filters work.
-  A tour helper that clicked in every defined action would be helpfull
   to detect possible issues.
