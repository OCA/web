This module allows to use a new widget for many2one fields that are made hierarchically.
Now, you can navigate easily between the hierarchy.

When we are using readonly, the behaviour is similar than Many2one, but on edition
we are able to select the parents and childs in order to navigate properly.

Usage
=====

Use child_selector widget on a field.
If necessary we can use child_selection_field on options in order to define
which field we will show on edition only.
For example, name instead of display_name.
