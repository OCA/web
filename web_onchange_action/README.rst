================
Onchange actions
================

This module allows you to return an action (``ir.actions.*``) from an onchange handler.

This way, you can have much more elaborate message boxes or simply show a whole wizard or do whatever else is possible with actions on the client side.

Usage
=====

Depend on this module and in your onchange handler, add a key ``action`` to the ``warning`` dictionary of the result which contains the definition of an action to execute:

.. code:: python

    {
        'value': ....,
        'domain': ....,
        'warning': {
            'title': 'This will be shown if this module is not available',
            'message': 'Fallback message, see above',
            # this module picks up this key and shows it *instead* of the
            # warning above
            'action': {
                'type': 'ir.actions.act_window',
                'res_model': 'my.wizard',
                ...
            },
    }

The module ``web_ir_actions_act_window_message`` can be quite helpful here.
