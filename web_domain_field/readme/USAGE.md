When you define a view you can specify on the relational fields a domain
attribute. This attribute is evaluated as filter to apply when
displaying existing records for selection.

``` xml
<field name="product_id" domain="[('type','=','product')]"/>
```

The value provided for the domain attribute must be a string
representing a valid Odoo domain. This string is evaluated on the client
side in a restricted context where we can reference as right operand the
values of fields present into the form and a limited set of functions.

In this context it's hard to build complex domain and we are facing to
some limitations as:

> - The syntax to include in your domain a criteria involving values
>   from a x2many field is complex.
> - The right side of domain in case of x2many can involve huge amount
>   of ids (performance problem).
> - Domains computed by an onchange on an other field are not recomputed
>   when you modify the form and don't modify the field triggering the
>   onchange.
> - It's not possible to extend an existing domain. You must completely
>   redefine the domain in your specialized addon
> - etc...

In order to mitigate these limitations this new addon allows you to use
the value of a field as domain of an other field in the xml definition
of your view.

``` xml
<field name="product_id_domain" invisible="1"/>
<field name="product_id" domain="product_id_domain"/>
```

The field used as domain must provide the domain as a JSON encoded
string.

``` python
product_id_domain = fields.Char(
    compute="_compute_product_id_domain",
    readonly=True,
    store=False,
)

@api.depends('name')
def _compute_product_id_domain(self):
    for rec in self:
        rec.product_id_domain = json.dumps(
            [('type', '=', 'product'), ('name', 'like', rec.name)]
        )
```
