This module integrates drag and drop functionality with message composition form.

Message composition form already has drag and drop implemented via :code:`html` widget, but only for images. This module covers remaining files, which are then automatically attached via drag and drop (instead of being manually uploaded).

Further, this module makes sure, that :code:`web_drop_target` won't overwrite :code:`html` widget drag and drop feature.
