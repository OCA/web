=====================
Web widget radio tree
=====================

This module allows to use input radio in a tree view inside a form, in order to ensure the user marks only one record.

Example: You have a partner company form with many contacts. The contacts are shown in a tree and you want to specify only one as preferred.

Usage
=====

In the view declaration, put widget='radio_tree' attribute in the field tag. The field type should be boolean::

    ...
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form>
            ...
            <field name="name" />
            <field name="contact_ids">
                <tree string="View name">
                    ...
                    <field name="name"/>
                    <field name="preferred" widget="radio_tree"/>
                    ...
                </tree>
            </field>
        </form>
    </field>
    ...
