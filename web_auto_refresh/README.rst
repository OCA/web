Web Auto Refresh
===========

Standard odoo 10.0 only support auto refreshing the inbox message, for kanban and list view when underlying model data updated by others, even though the auto search option in ir.actions.act_window activated, system will not auto refresh the kanban and list view as expected, this small module just fills this gap, this module is useful for keep monitoring orders, tickets etc without manual refresh the browser.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. go to setting->technical->actions->window actions, find the desired action, activate the auto search Check box

    model.env['bus.bus'].sendone('web_auto_refresh', model._name)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* From Techical point of view, the high level implementation detail is as following
    1. on backend(Python code triggered by automated server action), generate one record into model bus.bus(notification) when relevant model data updated(create/write/unlink) by calling the bus.sendone('channel','message')
    2. on frontend(javascript), declare the event listener to handle the notification message, check to see whether the notification(message)  is relevant for the current view/ user, if so auto refresh the view, either call reload(),do_reload(), or do_search_view_search()
