After install this module, you will not see anymore the
"Manage Databases" link in login screen.

See the image bellow:

.. image:: web_nocreatedb/static/src/img/screen.png

How to use:

When you start your server add the name of this module in the "load" option::

    $./openerp-server --load=web,web_nocreatedb -u all -d database

Then you can start your server without the -u and -d (just the first time you
need update all to be sure all base and web will be fine).

With this option you can just take off and restart the server if you need to show 
the link temporaly again.

TODO: It should be great add a parameter in the database to hide it configurable
way and with web_preload: True, but BTW, in old versions of openerp it was a 
parameter in the config file, i think as it is is fine for now.

.. note:: This module probably will not be shown in your module list by default
You should create a menu to see "All modules without filter.
