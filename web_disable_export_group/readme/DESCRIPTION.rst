In the standard Odoo the UI option 'Export' that is present in the 'Action' menu
and the 'Export All' button of any list view is always enabled (for every user).

This module makes the option 'Export' and 'Export All' enabled only for the users
that belong to the Export Data group.

Admin user can always use the export option.
