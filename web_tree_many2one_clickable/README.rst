========================================
Clickable many2one fields for tree views
========================================

This addon provides a separate widget to allow many2one or reference fields in
a tree view open the linked resource when clicking on their name.

You can also define a system parameter to have this behaviour for all the
existing many2one fields in tree views.

Installation
============

Install it the regular way.

Configuration
=============

After installation, all many2one and reference fields will be clickable
by default. You can change this in *Configuration > Technical > Parameters > System parameters*,
parameter with name `web_tree_many2one_clickable.default` setting it to `false`.

Usage
=====

For the widget option, you need to add `widget="many2one_clickable"` attribute
in the XML field definition in the tree view.

For example:

`<field name="partner_id" widget="many2one_clickable" />`

will open the linked partner in a form view.

If system parameter `web_tree_many2one_clickable.default` is `true` and you
need to disable one field, then use `widget="many2one_unclickable"`
