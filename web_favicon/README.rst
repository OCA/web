====================
Custom shortcut icon
====================

This module was written to allow you to customize your Odoo instance's shortcut
icon (aka favicon). This is useful for branding purposes, but also for
integrators who have many different Odoo instances running and need to see at a
glance which browser tab does what.

Configuration
=============

Upload your favicon (16x16, 32x32 or 64x64 pixels, 16 colors) on the company
form. The file format whould be ico, gif or png with 16x16, 32x32 or 64x64
pixels and 16 colors.

Note that most browsers cache favicons basically forever, so if you want your
icon to show up, you'll most probably have to delete you browser cache.
