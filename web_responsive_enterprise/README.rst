Automatic changelog generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`HISTORY.rst` can be auto generated using `towncrier <https://pypi.org/project/towncrier>`_.

Just put towncrier compatible changelog fragments into `readme/newsfragments`
and the changelog file will be automatically generated and updated when a new fragment is added.

Please refer to `towncrier` documentation to know more.

NOTE: the changelog will be automatically generated when using `/ocabot merge $option`.
If you need to run it manually, refer to `OCA/maintainer-tools README <https://github.com/OCA/maintainer-tools>`_.
