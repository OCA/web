# Hide link to database manager in login screen
This module hides the "Manage Databases" link at the bottom of login screen.
The image in *web_hide_db_manager_link/static/src/img/screen.png* shows the resulting loging screen.


## How to use it
As in Odoo v8 templates only live in the database, this module must be installed in each database you want this to be in effect.
