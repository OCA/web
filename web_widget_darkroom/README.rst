DarkroomJS Image Editing for Web
================================

This module provides a `DarkroomJS`_ (v2.0.1) web widget for use with image
fields. It also adds a Darkroom button to the normal image widget, which can
be used to edit the image via Darkroom in a modal.

.. _DarkroomJS: https://github.com/MattKetmo/darkroomjs

The widget currently supports the following operations and can be extended to
allow others:

* Zoom and pan
* Rotate
* Crop
* Step back in history client-side (before save)

Usage
=====

After installing the module, you can use it in the following ways:

* Specify the ``darkroom`` widget when adding an image field to a view.
  Configuration values can be provided using the ``options`` attribute::

  <field name="image" widget="darkroom" options="{'minWidth': 100}"/>

  The widget passes options directly through to DarkroomJS, which supports the
  following:

  * minWidth
  * minHeight
  * maxWidth
  * maxHeight
  * ratio (aspect ratio)
  * backgroundColor

* Open a form view that contains an image in edit mode and hover over the
  image widget. You should see a Darkroom button that can be clicked to open
  the image in a Darkroom modal, where it can be edited and the changes can be
  saved.
