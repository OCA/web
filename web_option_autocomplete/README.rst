==================================
Autocomplete option on char fields
==================================

This module was written to allow you to set the 'autocomplete' attribute on the 'input' element of a char field.

This is mainly useful for cases whereby a certain API password needs to be configured and the browser has the nerve to suggest the Odoo login password, and will even override the correct password that is there, which can cause all kinds of mayhem.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. depend on this module
#. define a key ``autocomplete`` in the field's options dictionary::

       <field name="username" options="{'autocomplete': 'off'}" />
       <field name="username" options="{'autocomplete': 'new-password'}" />
