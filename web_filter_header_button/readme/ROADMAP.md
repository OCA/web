- Group filters by kind
- As we use the `context` attribute, the inheritance could be limiting in some cases. Keep it in mind or use `base_view_inheritance_extension` if you want to use proper context inheritance.
- Another nice to have would be to be able to hide the filters in the filter list to be
  able to show them just in the header, although there's not a straigh forward way to
  do it and it could lead to side effects.
