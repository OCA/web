control panel.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This developement is aimed to ease the filter access for touch screens
users.

Configuration
=============

To show a filter in the header of the views, it should have the a
``context`` attribute with the key ``shown_in_panel``.

.. code:: xml

   <filter
       string="My filter"
       name="my_filter"
       domain="[('active', '!=', False)]"
       context="{'shown_in_panel': True}"
   >

This will show the filter in the header with its name. You can customize
the button adding an icon or with a custom name passing an object to
that key:

.. code:: python

   {'shown_in_panel': {'icon': 'fa-thumbs-up', 'name': 'Ok'}}

You might be interested in leaving just the icon. In that case, set an
empty string on the ``name`` property:

.. code:: python

   {'shown_in_panel': {'icon': 'fa-thumbs-up', 'name': ''}}

You could also want to add a hotkey. In such case add the ``hotkey``
property:

.. code:: python

   {'shown_in_panel': {'icon': 'fa-thumbs-up', 'hotkey': 'F'}}

You can show filter, groups or even favorites.

Usage
=====

There's a demo implementation in ``Apps`` and you can play around
following the *Configure* section.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Group filters by kind
-  As we use the ``context`` attribute, the inheritance could be
   limiting in some cases. Keep it in mind or use
   ``base_view_inheritance_extension`` if you want to use proper context
   inheritance.
-  Another nice to have would be to be able to hide the filters in the
   filter list to be able to show them just in the header, although
   there's not a straigh forward way to do it and it could lead to side
   effects.
