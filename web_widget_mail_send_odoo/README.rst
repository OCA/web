Web Widget - Internal mail wizard for email links
=================================================

This module was written to provide a new widget for Email fields to replace the
standard behaviour of displaying a 'mailto:' link with JS to open the internal
Email wizard from Odoo for message composition.

The message you sent gets appended to the chatter as if you where using internal
mail functions of Odoo.

* Install the module.
* It will replace the default widget for email fields.
