* Big inputs on form in edit mode

**Features for desktop computers**:

* Keyboard shortcuts for easier navigation,
  **using `Alt + Shift + [NUM]`** combination instead of
  just `Alt + [NUM]` to avoid conflict with Firefox Tab switching.
  Standard Odoo keyboard hotkeys changed to be more intuitive or
  accessible by fingers of one hand.
  F.x. `Alt + S` for `Save`

  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/web/15.0/web_responsive/static/img/shortcuts.gif

* Sticky chatter topbar

  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/web/15.0/web_responsive/static/img/chatter_topbar.gif

* When the chatter is configured on the side part, the document viewer fills that
  part for side-by-side reading instead of full screen. You can still put it on full
  width preview clicking on the new maximize button.

  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/web/15.0/web_responsive/static/img/document_viewer.gif

* When the user chooses to send a public message the color of the composer is different
  from the one when the message is an internal log.
