Usage
=====

The following keyboard shortcuts are implemented:

* Toggle App Drawer - `ActionKey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_key#Access_in_different_browsers>` + ``A``
* Navigate Apps Drawer - Arrow Keys
* Type to select App Links
* ``esc`` to close App Drawer

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Note: Data added to the footer ``support_branding`` is not shown while using
this module.

* Provide full menu search feature instead of just App search
* Drag drawer from left to open in mobile
* Figure out how to test focus on hidden elements for keyboard nav tests
* If you resize the window, body gets a wrong ``overflow: auto`` css property
  and you need to refresh your view or open/close the app drawer to fix that.
* Override LESS styling to allow for responsive widget layouts
* Adding ``oe_main_menu_navbar`` ID to the top navigation bar triggers some
  great styles, but also `JavaScript that causes issues on mobile
  <https://github.com/OCA/web/pull/446#issuecomment-254827880>`_
* Sticky header and footer in list view only works on certain browsers:
  https://caniuse.com/#search=sticky (note that the used feature is in
  `thead`).
* On Android (FireFox) - clicking the search icon does not
  focus the search input.
* On Android (FireFox & Chrome) - clicking the search query input will
  show the on screen keyboard for a split second, but the App Drawer
  immediately closes and the keyboard closes with it.
* Filter menu items completely on client-side, to make it smoother and allow
  users to filter on complete paths of menus and not only on the last item.
