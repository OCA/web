Add this method in the res model of the pivot view, where the list named 'fields_to hide'
id a comma separated list of the measures to hide

```python

@api.model
def fields_get(self, fields=None, attributes=None):
  fields_to_hide = [
    'field1', 'field2', 'field3'
  ]
  res = super(ModelName, self).fields_get(
    fields, attributes)
  for field in fields_to_hide:
    res[field]['selectable'] = False
  return res
```

Known issues
============
This module depends on the 'dirty' flag that Odoo sets on modified forms. Odoo
only sets this flag when the focus is changed, so if you modified only one
field and the focus is still on that field, you won't be prevented from closing
the browser window.
