This module adds a form view widget that makes it possible to paint and save the resulting picture
into a binary field of the form view model.

The starting image can be a static image, uploaded or retrieved from another binary field.

The painted image can be reset at any time to the predefined static or dynamic image.

The toolbox, based on the Fabrics.js (version 1.7.6) library(cf. http://fabricjs.com/),
has different brushes and markers whereby shape, size, shadow and color can be selected.
