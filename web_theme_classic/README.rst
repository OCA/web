This module extend the Odoo Community Edition ``web`` module to improve
visibility of form view.

**Rational:** Since Odoo V17, the design is very pure. That's great, but
it generates some problem for users :

-  Fields are not identifiable. (we can not know exactly where there are
   until you hover over them with the cursor)
-  there is no indication for the required fields until trying to save
   (or exit the screen)

In a way, this module restores the form display of version 15, but
preserving the "save on the fly" new feature.
