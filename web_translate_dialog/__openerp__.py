{"name": "Web Translate Dialog",
 "category": "Hidden",
 "description": """
Replace the standard translation view by an alternative one:

 * Add a "Translate" button item in the "More" menu
 * The translations are displayed in a dialog (much like the OpenERP
   6.1's one)
 * The translation dialog displays empty fields for the untranslated fields,
   instead of the source values.
 * Support HTML fields
