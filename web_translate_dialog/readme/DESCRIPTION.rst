This module replaces the standard translation view by an easy-to-use pop-up
view where you can translate all the fields of the object in all the installed
languages (for long-time users, it may remind them the translation pop-up of
OpenERP 6.1).

This module also features:

* A *Translate* button item in the *More* menu
* Support for HTML fields
* Autosize the textareas to the size of the content
