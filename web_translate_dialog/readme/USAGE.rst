Go to an object that has translatable fields (*Products* for example) and
select *More > Translate* (or click on *Edit* and then click on the flag at
the top-right of one of the translatable fields): the translation view will
pop-up on your screen. This translation view contains all the translatable
fields of the object.

If you click in the standard translate icon then the translation view will
pop-up with this field only.
