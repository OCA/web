====================
Web Translate Dialog
====================

This module replaces the standard translation view by an easy-to-use pop-up
view where you can translate all the fields of the object in all the installed
languages (for long-time users, it may remind them the translation pop-up of
OpenERP 6.1).

This module also features:

* A *Translate* button item in the *More* menu
* Support for HTML fields
* Autosize the textareas to the size of the content

Usage
=====

Go to an object that has translatable fields (*Products* for example) and
select *More > Translate* (or click on *Edit* and then click on the flag at
the top-right of one of the translatable fields): the translation view will
pop-up on your screen. This translation view contains all the translatable
fields of the object.

If you click in the standard translate icon then the translation view will
pop-up with this field only.
