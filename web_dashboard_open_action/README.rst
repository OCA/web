Open a dashboard's action
=========================

This module adds a button to open a dashboard's action in the usual view, thus enabling filtering and any other actions you can apply on the resulting records. Basically, this is the inverso to `Add to dashboard`.

Usage

After installation, a dashboard has a `Maximize`-button that loads the dashboard's action in a normal view.
