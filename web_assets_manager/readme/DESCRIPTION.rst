Manage web assets for specific pages. By default Odoo website visitors download many large asset bundles which is bad for their performance. This module allows to customize the asset bundles to improve website performance. This can be useful for static webpages (other than portal users and online shop) in particular.

The web assets can exclude specific files only for a few URLs while other parts of the website can still load them. To temporarily disable the filtering you can add `debug=unfiltered`.
