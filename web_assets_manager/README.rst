Manage web assets for specific pages. By default Odoo website visitors download many large asset bundles which is bad for their performance. This module allows to customize the asset bundles to improve website performance. This can be useful for static webpages (other than portal users and online shop) in particular.

The web assets can exclude specific files only for a few URLs while other parts of the website can still load them. To temporarily disable the filtering you can add `debug=unfiltered`.

Usage
=====

1. Create a static webpage which contains all website blocks (widgets) you may want to use on static webpages. You may want to do this on a test system.

2. Go to `Settings -> Technical -> Web Assets` and create entries of bundles which you want to modify. Typically you may want to modify the bundles `web.assets_frontend`, `web.assets_frontend_minimal`, `web.assets_frontend_lazy`, `web.assets_common`, `web.assets_common_lazy`, and `web.assets_common_minimal`. Define a Regex rule to match one or multiple pages (e.g. `/test` to match the webpage with URL `example.com/test`).

3. Open a website which matches the defined Regex with the URL parameter "debug=assets" to generate the file lists.

4. Start excluding files from certain bundles. You may sort by size and start with the largest files. Or you group by module which should give a good overview which modules and their assets may not be required (and thus may be excluded).

5. Open and test the webpage again and check if it still works as expected. Repeat this and the previous steps again and again until your assets bundels are as minimal as desired.

6. Modified assets can be downloaded from one system (e.g. test system) and uploaded to another system (e.g. production system)
