        Odoo uses a few bundles for web assets which can grow quite large with
        more and more modules in use. This reduces SEO rankings for static pages
        because a lot of not necessary code is being loaded by the clients.

        This module allows to control a bit further which file of the bundles is
        delivered for specific pages.
