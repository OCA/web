==================
Client side paging
==================

This addon allows a developer to return the following action types::

{'type': 'ir.actions.act_window.page.next'}

or::

{'type': 'ir.actions.act_window.page.prev'}

which trigger the form's controller to page into the requested direction on the
client side.

A use case could be the case of a validation flow. As a developer, you set up a tree view with a domain on records to be validated. The user opens the first record in a form view and validates the record. The validation method returns the 'next' action type so that the browser window of the user is presented with the next record in the form view.
