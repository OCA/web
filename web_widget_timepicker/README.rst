===============================
Timepicker widget in form views
===============================

This module provides a timepicker widget for float fields.
It can be used as a replacement for the standard float_time widget in form views.


|picker|


The widget has the following default timepicker options:

* the possible selection is based on 15 minute interval (step: 15)
* 24 hour mode in H:i format (timeFormat: 'H:i')
* scroll selection starts at current time (scrollDefault: 'now')


|formview|


Usage
=====

In the form view declaration, put widget='timepicker' attribute in the field tag::

    ...
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <form string="View name">
            ...
            <field name="name"/>
            <field name="mytimefieldname" widget="timepicker"/>
            ...
        </form>
    </field>
    ...

Additional jquery-timepicker plugin options can be specified by an options attribute::

    ...
    <field name="mytimefieldname" widget="timepicker" options="{'step': '30', 'disableTextInput': false}"/>
    ...

See the available options at `jquery-timepicker <https://github.com//jonthornton//jquery-timepicker#timepicker-plugin-for-jquery>`_.
