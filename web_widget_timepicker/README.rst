or (function) fields of type character. Use ``widget='timepicker'`` in your form view
definition.

If you use the widget with a character field, the input field has the following default
timepicker options:

* By default direct input is disabled
* By default the possible selection is based on 15 minute interval
* By default 24 hour mode with H:i format
* Scroll selection defaults to current server time

The widget uses the jquery.timepicker plugin by Jon  Thornton

ToDo
