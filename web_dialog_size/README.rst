=============
Expand Dialog
=============

A module that lets the user expand/restore the dialog box size through a button
in the upper right corner (mimicking most windows managers).
It does also add draggable support to the dialogs.

Configuration
=============

By default, the module respects the caller's `dialog_size` option. If you want
to override this and have all dialogs maximized by default, set the configuration
parameter `web_dialog_size.default_maximize` to `1`.
