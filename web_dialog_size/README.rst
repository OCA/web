Expand Dialog
=============

A module that lets the user expand/restore the dialog box size through a button
in the upper right corner (mimicking most windows managers). By default,
all dialog boxes are expanded.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Provide a system parameter that allows to set default size (normal/expanded).
