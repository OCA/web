Hide menus
==========

This addon hides the top and left menu bars. They become visible again when you move the mouse towards the border of the screen (the distance is configurable). Moving the mouse out of a menu causes it to disappear after a configurable delay.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* go to Settings / Technical / Parameters / System Parameters
* adjust `web_menu_autohide.show_bar_threshold_navbar` and `web_menu_autohide.show_bar_threshold_leftbar` to set the distance in pixels from the border from which the menu appears (default is 10 pixels, a value of `0` disables hiding)
* adjust `web_menu_autohide.hide_delay_navbar` and `web_menu_autohide.hide_delay_leftbar` to set the amount of milliseconds after which the menu disappears if the mouse left it (default is 10 seconds)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module heavily relies on mouse events, so it probably messes things up for touchscreens
