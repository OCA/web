Clickjacking is a technique by which a malicious party embeds your website in an <iframe>, then hovers buttons over it to make the user think he is clicking on your site when in fact he is communicating with the parent frame.

Clickjacking can be prevented on the webserver side by adding headers, but there are `ways around this <https://github.com/niutech/x-frame-bypass>`_. This module prevents clickjacking more thoroughly by making it impossible for your site to be embedded. It does so by adding a small "framebreaker" Javascript which creates a CSS style element on the fly to hide the body of the current page by default. Then, if it doesn't detect a parent frame, it removes it again.
