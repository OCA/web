Developer Mode restricted
=========================

This module makes *Developer Mode* link (in the *About Odoo* dialog) visibility optional based on users' groups.

This way, only those users belonging to a specific group will have access to *Developer Mode* link.


Known issues
============

So far, only the link is removed, but debug mode can still be activated via URL.

It would be nice to totally disallow debug mode behaviour.
