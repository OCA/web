This module aims to add support for dynamically coloring fields in tree view
according to data in the record.

Features
========

* Add attribute ``bg_color`` on field's ``options`` to color background of a cell in tree view
* Add attribute ``fg_color`` on field's ``options`` to change text color of a cell in tree view

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

* In the tree view declaration, put ``options='{"bg_color": "red: customer==True"}`` attribute in the ``field`` tag::

    ...
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <tree string="View name">
            ...
            <field name="name" options='{"bg_color": "red: customer == True"}'/>
            ...
        </tree>
    </field>
    ...

    With this example, column which renders 'name' field will have its background colored in red.

* In the tree view declaration, put ``options='{"fg_color": "white:customer == True"}'`` attribute in the ``field`` tag::

    ...
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <tree string="View name">
            ...
            <field name="name" options='{"fg_color": "white:customer == True"}'/>
            ...
        </tree>
    </field>
    ...

    With this example, column which renders 'name' field will have its text colored in white on a customer records.

* If you want to use more than one color, you can split the attributes using ';':

.. code::

   options='{"fg_color": "red:red_color == True; green:green_color == True"}'

Example:

.. code:: xml

   ...
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <tree string="View name">
            ...
            <field name="name" options='{"fg_color": "red:red_color == True; green:green_color == True"}'/>
            ...
        </tree>
    </field>
    ...

    With this example, the content of the field named `my_color` will be used to
    populate the `my_color` CSS value. Use a function field to return whichever
    color you want depending on the other record values. Note that this
    overrides the rest of `colors` attributes, and that you need the tree
    to load your field in the first place by adding it as invisible field.

**Note that you should always use single quotes for fields' ``options`` and wrap nested values in double quotes since ``options`` is a JSON object.**

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Before version 13.0, this module had a feature allowing to change the color of
  a line depending on a field, using a ``colors`` attribute with the name of the
  field on the ``<tree>`` element. Since 13.0, the ``colors`` attribute is no
  longer in the RelaxNG schema of the tree view, so we can't use it anymore.
  This feature has then been dropped, but could be reimplement in another way.
