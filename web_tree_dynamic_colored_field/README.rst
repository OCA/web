This module aims to add support for dynamically coloring fields in tree
view according to data in the record.

Features
--------

-  Add attribute ``bg_color`` on field's ``options`` to color background
   of a cell in tree view
-  Add attribute ``fg_color`` on field's ``options`` to change text
   color of a cell in tree view

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

-  In the tree view declaration, put
   ``options='{"bg_color": "red: customer==True"}`` attribute in the
   ``field`` tag:

   ::

      ...
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
          <tree string="View name">
              ...
              <field name="name" options='{"bg_color": "red: customer == True"}'/>
              ...
          </tree>
      </field>
      ...

      With this example, column which renders 'name' field will have its **background** colored in red on customer records.

-  In the tree view declaration, put
   ``options='{"fg_color": "white:customer == True"}'`` attribute in the
   ``field`` tag:

   ::

      ...
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
          <tree string="View name">
              ...
              <field name="name" options='{"fg_color": "white:customer == True"}'/>
              ...
          </tree>
      </field>
      ...

      With this example, column which renders 'name' field will have its **text** colored in white on customer records.

-  If you want to use more than one color, you can split the attributes
   using ';':

::

   options='{"fg_color": "red:red_color == True; green:green_color == True"}'

Example:

.. code:: xml

   ...
    <field name="arch" type="xml">
        <tree string="View name">
            ...
            <field name="name" options='{"fg_color": "red:red_color == True; green:green_color == True"}'/>
            ...
        </tree>
    </field>
    ...

-  Can use strings too... In the tree view declaration, put
   ``options="{'fg_color': 'green:customer_state == \'success\''}"``
   attribute in the ``field`` tag:

   ::

      ...
      <field name="arch" type="xml">
          <tree string="View name">
              ...
              <field name="name" options="{'fg_color': 'green:customer_state == \'success\''}"/>
              ...
          </tree>
      </field>
      ...

**Note that you can use single or normal quotes. If the declaration of
the options doesn't follow the JSON format, the options string will be
evaluated using py.eval()**

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Before version 13.0, this module had a feature allowing to change the
   color of a line depending on a field, using a ``colors`` attribute
   with the name of the field on the ``<tree>`` element. Since 13.0, the
   ``colors`` attribute is no longer in the RelaxNG schema of the tree
   view, so we can't use it anymore. This feature has then been dropped,
   but could be reimplement in another way.
-  Since version 17.0 coloring is written into ``style`` attribute of
   (td) element
