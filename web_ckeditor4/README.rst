CKEditor web widget
===================

This addon provides a widget for editing html fields via CKEditor 4.6.6

Configuration
=============

In your view definition, use widget="text_html" if you need just html display.
In the unlikely case you need specific features of ckeditor,
use widget="text_ckeditor4".

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This version of CKEditor contains a patch that prevents the referencing of
  the editor's iframe if it has already been cleaned up by Odoo. In 8.0, this is
  the case if the editor was created in an x2many popup. The patch was proposed
  as https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/pull/200
