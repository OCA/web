`Bokeh <https://bokeh.pydata.org>`__ is a Python interactive visualization
library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to
provide elegant, concise construction of basic exploratory and advanced
custom graphics in the style of D3.js, but also deliver this capability with
high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh
can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive
plots, dashboards, and data applications.

If you want to see some samples of bokeh's capabilities follow this `link
<https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html>`_.

Installation
============

You need to install the python bokeh library::

    pip3 install bokeh==1.1.0

Usage
=====

To insert a Bokeh chart in a view proceed as follows:

#. Declare a text computed field like this::

    bokeh_chart = fields.Text(
        string='Bokeh Chart',
        compute='_compute_bokeh_chart',
    )

#. In its computed method do::

    def _compute_bokeh_chart(self):
        for rec in self:
            # Design your bokeh figure:
            p = figure()  # import that as `from bokeh.plotting import figure`
            line = p.line([0, 2], [1, 8], line_width=5)
            # (...)
            # fill the record field with both markup and the script of a chart.
            script, div = components(p)
            rec.bokeh_chart = '%s%s' % (div, script)

#. In the view, add something like this wherever you want to display your
   bokeh chart::

    <div>
        <field name="bokeh_chart" widget="bokeh_chart" nolabel="1"/>
    </div>
