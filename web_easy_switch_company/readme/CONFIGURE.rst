When you switch the company, you can choose to stay on the current model and
item, you are viewing, or to go back to the home page. (by default)

To configure that setting:

* Go to 'Settings' / 'Technical' / 'Parameters' / 'system Parameters'
* Set the key ``web_easy_switch_company.keep_url`` to ``True`` to keep the url
  when switching the company.
