==================================================
Allows multiple selection on many2many_tags widget
==================================================

In a many2many_tags widget when a lot of entries should be selected it's
fastidious to select 80% of them. Then you may click on 'search more',
but impossible to select several attributes at once.

This module adds a checkbox to this list so multiple entries can be selected
at once.

Installation
============

It was tested on Odoo 7.0 branch.

Configuration
=============

Once installed, there is nothing else to do.

Usage
=====

Open the `search more...` popup on any ``many2many_tags`` widget.
