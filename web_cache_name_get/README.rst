==================
Web Cache Name Get
==================

This module improves the loading time of some views: mainly sale or purchase orders 
with many order lines.

It reduce the number of useless requests done by the user's browser.


This modules cache some requests to name_get() done from list views.

For instance, if you have 40 sale order lines on a sale. All these lines have the same tax.

- Without this module : your browser makes about 40 time the same name_get() request.
- With this modules: your browser makes 1 request and reuse the result for all the lines.

It works on many2many and many2one on list views.
The cache is cleaned when you navigate to other objects.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The cache is not very aggressive, if put more globally it may catch more useless requests.
* some requests can be done twice in many2one, because of 'this' been erased in
other parts of the core code.
