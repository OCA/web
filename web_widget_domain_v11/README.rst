===============================
Odoo 11.0 Domain Widget Preview
===============================

This module replaces the functionality of the domain widget to use a preview of
the brand new interface that will be found in Odoo 11.0.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Enable the developer mode.
#Â· Go to *Settings > Technical > User interface > User-defined Filters* and
   choose or create one.
#. Choose a model if there is none.
#. You will be able to choose the domain using the updated domain widget.

Install any addon that makes use of the domain widget (i.e. ``mass_mailing``)
and you will be also able to use the new widget there.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This addon replaces the built-in ``char_domain`` widget, so it can break
  compatibility with other addons that use or extend it.
