Web Tree No Open
================

This module extends the functionality of tree views.
It adds a new configuration attribute 'open' to trees, very similiar to the
existing attributes 'edit', 'create' and 'delete'

The new attribute makes it possible to deactivate the onclick behaviour in tree
views.
::

   <tree open="false" >
