Usage
=====

In attributes select "Display type" to "Product image"

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* For the correct functioning of the module I had to rewrite .css_attribute_color, impacting the way of representing the selection by colors.

Ideally this should not be necessary, help is required for this process.

* The combination of more than one property cannot obtain the product identifier, therefore the images are not shown, this would be something to solve.
