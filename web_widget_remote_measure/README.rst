This module allows to input data from remote devices in your network. Currently, only
websockets devices are supported, but it can be extended for any protocol like
Webservices.

Other modules can extend this one in order to use the widget.

Configuration
=============

To configure your remote devices:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Devices > Remote devices*
#. Create a new one configuring the required info.
#. If the devices has an special port, set it up in the host data: e.g.: 10.1.1.2:3210

Usage
=====

The remote device has to be in the users network so their web clients can reach them.

In order to test a device you can:

#. Go to *Settings > Technical > Devices > Remote devices*
#. In the Kanban view you'll wich devices can be reached as they'll have a green dot in
   their card.
#. Go to one of those and click *Edit*.
#. You can start measuring from the remote device in the *Test measure* field.

On the technical side, you can use the widget in your own `Float``. You'll need to
provide an uom field so records that aren't in that UoM don't measure from the device.

.. code:: xml

    <field name="float_field" widget="remote_measure" options="{'remote_device_field': 'measure_device_id', 'uom_field': 'uom_id'}" />

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Current support:

- Websockets connection
- F501 protocol on continuous message stream.

But this is a commonground to add:

- Other connection interfaces like Webservices APIs
- Other device protocols.
- Active device controls, la Tare, resets, etc.
