This addon allows users to apply set operations on filters: Remove or add
certain ids from/to a selection, but also to remove or add another filter's
outcome from/to a filter. This can be stacked, so the filter domain can be
arbitrarily complicated.

The math is hidden from the user as far as possible, in the hope it's still
user friendly.

Usage
=====

After this addon is installed, every search view shows a new menu `Advanced
filters`. Here the set operations can be applied as necessary.

Note the menu is only visible when there's search criteria or some record
selected.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* client side tests
* consider renaming all instances of `Favorites` in core to `Filters` for consistency
