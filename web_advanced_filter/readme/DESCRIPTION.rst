This addon allows users to apply set operations on filters: Remove or add
certain ids from/to a selection, but also to remove or add another filter's
outcome from/to a filter. This can be stacked, so the filter domain can be
arbitrarily complicated.

The math is hidden from the user as far as possible, in the hope it's still
user friendly.
