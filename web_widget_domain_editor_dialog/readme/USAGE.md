In any view with a domain field widget and model, but we'll make the
example with a user filter:

1.  Enter debug mode.
2.  Go to the *Debug menu* and select the option *Manage Filters*
3.  Create a new one
4.  Put a name to the filter and select a model (e.g.: Contact)
5.  Click on the record selection button and a list dialog opens. There
    you can either:

> - Select individual records: those ids will be added to the domain.
> - Set filters that will be applied to the domain and select all the
>   records to add it as a new filter.
> - Set groups that will be converted into search filters, select all
>   the records and those unfolded groups will be set as filters to.

You can still edit the filter with Odoo's widget after that.
