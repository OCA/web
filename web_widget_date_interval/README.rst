==============
Date intervals
==============

This module was written to allow users to select some visual presentation of an interval instead of selecting a begin or end date.

Usage
=====

To use this module, use the widget ``date_interval`` on the field representing the begin of the interval. Make sure to also add the field representing the end of the interval, usually as hidden. Also add an ``options`` dictionary where you at least set the keys ``type`` and ``end_field``.

Depending on the type, you can add more configuration in the widget options, see below for a list depending on the interval type.

weeknumber_iso
--------------

``hide_years``
    if this is set, don't show a year selection
``years_before``
    allow the user to move to N years before the current date (or the field's value)
``years_after``
    allow the user to move to N years after the current date (or the field's value)
``week_type``
    `select` (default) will render a dropdown for weeks, `buttons` will show buttons
``weeks_before``
    allow the user to move to N weeks before the current date (or the field's value) if ``week_type`` has value `buttons`
``weeks_after``
    allow the user to move to N weeks after the current date (or the field's value) if ``week_type`` has value `buttons`


Example::

    <field name="date_start" widget="date_interval" options="{'type': 'weeknumber_iso', 'end_field': 'date_end'}" />

The module's demo data adds this to the form of model constraints.

Roadmap
=======

* add more interval types
