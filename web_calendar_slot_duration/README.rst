This module extends the functionality of backend calendars to support custom
slot durations and to allow you to provide more specific UX regarding event
duration and snapping.

Configuration
=============

This documentation is for developers.

If you want to configure your calendar view's snap duration, make sure that you
action includes a context similar to this (example is the default value)::

    {"calendar_slot_duration": "00:30:00"}

It can be added in actions defined on python or as ``ir.actions.act_window``
records.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to install some other addon that uses it, as it
doesn't provide any end-user functionality.

======================

* Drop module if/when https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/66739 is merged.
