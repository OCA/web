========================
Web Access Rules Buttons
========================

This addon disables the Edit button on the form views if the user
cannot edit the current record according to the record access rules.


Usage
=====

When using Odoo, even if a user has no rights to edit a record, the Edit button
is shown. The user can edit the record but won't be able to save his changes.
Now, the user won't be able to click on the Edit button.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Additional requests will be issued when a record is loaded in a form view in
  order to check if the user has the access right.
