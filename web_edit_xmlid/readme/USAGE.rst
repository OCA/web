To use this module, you need to:

#. Enable the debug mode to show the Developer menu.
#. Click on `View Metadata` to open the built-in metadata viewer.
#. If the record doesn't have an XML ID, the `Create` button will call
   the same built-in method used during a row export to generate a unique ID.

#. If the record is already linked to an XML ID, an `Edit` button will
   open a Form to update it.

   *Edit an existing XML ID*

   *XML ID editable form view*
