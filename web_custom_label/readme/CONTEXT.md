## BUSINESS NEED

As a customer, I want to customize the label of a field.

## APPROACH

1. Use Odoo Studio
    - Only available in Enterprise Version
2. Directly modifiy the XML
    - It's a technical way
    - On updating the module, you will loose the customization
3. Add a translation term
    - Can take a long time and not it's not really user friendly
4. Code a new module 
    - Need technical skills
5. Use web_custom_label module
    - Already available
    - User friendly
    - Customer can make changes by himself
    - No technical skills needed
