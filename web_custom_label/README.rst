Use Cases / Context
===================

[ ]

BUSINESS NEED
-------------

As a customer, I want to customize the label of a field.

APPROACH
--------

1. Use Odoo Studio

   -  Only available in Enterprise Version

2. Directly modifiy the XML

   -  It's a technical way
   -  On updating the module, you will loose the customization

3. Add a translation term

   -  Can take a long time and not it's not really user friendly

4. Code a new module

   -  Need technical skills

5. Use web_custom_label module

   -  Already available
   -  User friendly
   -  Customer can make changes by himself
   -  No technical skills needed

Usage
=====

Customizing Labels
------------------

In order to edit a label, you need to:

-  Go to
   ``Settings / Translations / Application Terms / Custom Labels``.
-  Add a new custom label.
-  Refresh your browser session in order to see the new label in your
   view.

Here is an example for products. We rename the field
``Internal Reference`` (default_code) with ``SKU``.

|alt text|

Note that we selected 2 models to modify; ``Product`` and
``Product Template``. This means we are modifying the label for both
product templates and variants.

Now, if we go to any for product form view, we get the new label
``SKU``.

Customizing Placeholers
-----------------------

The module also allows to modify the placeholders of a form view.

Here, we set custom placeholders on the street fields of partners /
addresses.

|image3|

Partners have multiple form views in Odoo.

Here, we did not have to specify which form view to edit. The new
placeholders are set in both the main partner form and the contact
address form.

|image5|

Customizing Helpers
-------------------

It is possible to customize a field helper.

|image6| |image7|

Customizing Selection Fields
----------------------------

Fields of type ``Selection`` can be customized.

In the list view of custom labels, a new position ``Selection`` and a
column ``Key`` were added. The ``Key`` contains the technical value of
the selection option to rename. |image8|

In the example above, the option ``contact`` of the field type of
``res.partner`` was renamed to ``Personne`` (in french).

In the form view of a contact, the term ``Contact`` is replaced with
``Personne``.

|image9|

Customizing Buttons
-------------------

In order to customize an element of the view that is not a field, we
need to target the element with an Xpath expression.

Let's say we want to customize the stock picking view and change the
``VALIDATE`` button to ``TRANSFER``.

|image10|

We add the custom label using an Xpath expression.

|image11|

Then, the label is updated on the button. |image12|

Comparison with Odoo Studio
---------------------------

When using Odoo Studio to modify a label, an inherited view is created
behind the scene. Thus, each label added using Odoo Studio is coupled
with the code. It adds complexity to deployments, because if the
inherited view changes, the Studio customization may become
incompatible.

Another downside is that when using Studio, you will need to edit every
view of your model. For example, products and partners have multiple
form views. If you change one label, you will need to change at multiple
places.

The module ``Web Custom Label`` does not add additionnal XML. It
modifies the view at the rendering, according to the language of the
user. If the inherited view changes, the system will not fail. You may
however end up with a wrong label inside a view and have to adjust the
custom label entry.
