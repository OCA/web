Adds a dashboard where you can configure tiles from any view and add them as short cut.

By default, the tile displays items count of a given model restricted to a given domain.

Optionally, the tile can display the result of a function on a field.

- Function is one of ``sum``, ``avg``, ``min``, ``max`` or ``median``.
- Field must be integer or float.

Tile can be:

- Displayed only for a user.
- Global for all users.
- Restricted to some groups.

*Note: The tile will be hidden if the current user doesn't have access to the given model.*

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

First, you have to create tile categories.

* Go to "Dashboards > Settings > Dashboard Categories"

* Click on Create

* Set a name, and save.

Odoo menu and action are automatically created.
You should refresh your browser to see new menu items.

Then you can create tiles.

* go to "Dashboards > Settings > Dashboard Tiles"

* create a new tile, set a name, a category and a model.

* You can optionally define colors, domain a specific action to use.

* Setting a user, or a group in "Security" tab will restrict the display of the tile.

You can optionally define a secondary value, for that purpose :

* Select a field, a function to apply.

* You can define a specific format. (``.format()`` python syntax)

**Note**

When you are in a tree view, with a domain, you can save it in the favorite menu, but the configuration is limited.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

**Known issues**

* Can not edit color from dashboard
* Original context is ignored.
* Original domain and filter are not restored.
* To preserve a relative date domain, you have to manually edit the tile's domain from "Configuration > User Interface > Dashboard Tile". You can use the same variables available in filters (``uid``, ``context_today()``, ``current_date``, ``time``, ``datetime``, `relativedelta`).

**Roadmap**

* Add icons.
* Support client side action (like inbox).
* Restore original Domain + Filter when an action is set.
* Posibility to hide the tile based on a field expression.
* Posibility to set the background color based on a field expression.
