Add Tiles to Dashboard
======================

module to give you a dashboard where you can configure tile from any view
and add them as short cut.

* Tile can be:
    * displayed only for a user;
    * global for all users (In that case, some tiles will be hidden if
      the current user doesn't have access to the given model);
* The tile displays items count of a given model restricted to a given domain;
* Optionnaly, the tile can display the result of a function of a field;
    * Function is one of sum/avg/min/max/median;
    * Field must be integer or float;
