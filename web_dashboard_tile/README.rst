Dashboard Tiles
===============

Adds a dashboard where you can configure tiles from any view
and add them as short cut.

* Tile can be:
    * Displayed only for a user.
    * Global for all users (In that case, some tiles will be hidden if
      the current user doesn't have access to the given model).
* The tile displays items count of a given model restricted to a given domain.
* Optionally, the tile can display the result of a function of a field
    * Function is one of sum/avg/min/max/median.
    * Field must be integer or float.

Usage
=====

* Dashboad sample, displaying Sale Orders to invoice:

.. image:: ./static/src/img/screenshot_dashboard.png

* Tree view displayed when user click on the tile:

.. image:: ./static/src/img/screenshot_action_click.png

Known issues
============
* Can not edit tile from dashboard (color, sequence, function, ...).
* Original context is ignored.
* Original domain and filter are not restored.
* To preserve a relative date domain, you have to manually edit the tile's domain from `Configuration > User Interface > Dashboard Tile`. You can use the same variables available in filters (`uid`, `context_today()`, `current_date`, `time`, `datetime`, `relativedelta`).

Roadmap
=======
* Add icons.
* Support client side action (like inbox).
* Restore original Domain + Filter when an action is set.
