**Known issues**

* Can not edit color from dashboard
* Original context is ignored.
* Original domain and filter are not restored.
* To preserve a relative date domain, you have to manually edit the tile's domain from "Configuration > User Interface > Dashboard Tile". You can use the same variables available in filters (``uid``, ``context_today()``, ``current_date``, ``time``, ``datetime``, `relativedelta`).

**Roadmap**

* Add icons.
* Support client side action (like inbox).
* Restore original Domain + Filter when an action is set.
* Posibility to hide the tile based on a field expression.
* Posibility to set the background color based on a field expression.
