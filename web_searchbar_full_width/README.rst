Odoo's default search bar is rather narrow, which causes it to grow vertically
when applying a lot of filters. For small screens this can be a problem as it
wastes a lot of space. This addon addresses this issue by growing the search
bar to the whole width of the screen, moving it below the breadcrumb. A side
effect of this is that the breadcrumb can also use the full screen width, which
makes it reasonable not to cut off titles after 7 characters.

The result looks like this:
