This module shows the sum of all submenus' needaction counters in main menus. This way, users get visual feedback where there's still work to do without having to open the respective menu beforehand.

The counters are updated periodically, so users will also be notified if there are new records that require attention.

Configuration
=============

To configure the update frequency, set the configuration parameter `web_menu_navbar_needaction.refresh_timeout` to the amount of milliseconds after which the counters should be updated. Don't do this too often, as this will cause a lot of queries to the database. The default it 600000, which is equivalent to 10 minutes.

To disable updates, set the parameter to 0.
