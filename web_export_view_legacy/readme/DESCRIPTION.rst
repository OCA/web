This module restores the original features introduced by web_export_view module (https://github.com/OCA/web/tree/12.0/web_export_view).
From 13.0 version it was obsoleted by the Export All button in Odoo standard, but the new feature doesn't allow to select records to export 
in current view and to print m2m in one cell as it was in the OCA module.

Installing this module you will be able to select rows to export in the current view and have m2m values concatenated in one cell.
