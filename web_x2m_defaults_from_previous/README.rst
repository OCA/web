x2many defaults
===============

This module was written to allow you to use the previous line's input as defaults for the next line you add.

Usage
=====

#. on a x2many field, say ``options="{'web_x2m_defaults_from_previous': ['field1', 'field2']}"``
#. after the first line of input, succeeding lines will have the last input's values as default
#. demo data adds this for the ACL list field in the groups form
