This module defines a new rtree view type. RTree stands for “real tree” or
“recursive tree”. It allows to display recursive and hierarchical data
structures.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

To use the rtree view on a model, a view of that type must be defined for that
model. It is defined in the same way as a normal list (tree) view, but using
an ``<rtree>`` element instead of ``<tree>`` and with additional ``<parent>``
elements to define the hierarchy.

Each ``<parent>`` element defines a parent-child relationship to display. It
has the following attributes:

* ``parent``: the parent model of this relationship.
* ``child``: the child model of this relationship.
* ``field``: the field of the child model to access the parent.
* ``domain`` (optional): an optional domain to use when loading the children
  for this relationship.
* ``expand`` (optional): an optional boolean value that controls whether this
  relationship should be expanded automatically (false by default).

The order of the ``<parent>`` elements controls the order of group types on
each level of the tree.

The root of the tree displays all groups and records that have no parent.

Here is an example to display projects with their tasks and sub-tasks
(recursively). At the root, it will display all projects (as groups) as well
as all tasks (as records) that have no parent and no project. Note that the
first relationship has a domain: this is to ensure that only tasks that have
no parent will be shown as children of their project. Moreover, the first
relationship has the ``expand`` boolean set to true, while the second hasn't:
this means that project groups will be expanded automatically, but tasks with
sub-tasks will not.

.. code-block:: XML

    <record id="project_task_view_rtree" model="ir.ui.view">
        <field name="name">An rtree view for tasks</field>
        <field name="model">project.task</field>
        <field name="arch" type="xml">
            <rtree>
                <parent
                    parent="project.project"
                    child="project.task"
                    field="project_id"
                    domain="[('parent_id', '=', False)]"
                    expand="true"
                />
                <parent
                    parent="project.task"
                    child="project.task"
                    field="parent_id"
                />

                <field name="name" />
                <field name="milestone_id" />
                <!-- add more fields -->
            </rtree>
        </field>
    </record>

To make the view available, the ``rtree`` view mode must be added to the list
of view modes (``view_mode`` field) of the window action.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Does not work currently:

* Filtering (including defining where to start in the hierarchy): the search
  domain is ignored and the full hierarchy is always shown
* Pagination and limiting the number of results
* Remembering the state of open parents (to keep it in the current state when
  navigating back to the view)
* Sorting of columns
* Navigating between records accessed from the view
* Validation of the view definition
