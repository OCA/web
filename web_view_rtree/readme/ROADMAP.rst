Does not work currently:

* Editing records
* Pagination and limiting the number of results
* Sorting of secondary model rows by column
* Navigating between records accessed from the view
* Validation of the view definition

Displaying fields of secondary models is limited. It only works with simple
(non-relational) fields of the same type as those of the primary model.
