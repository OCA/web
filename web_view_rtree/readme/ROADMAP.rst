Does not work currently:

* Pagination and limiting the number of results
* Sorting of columns
* Navigating between records accessed from the view
* Validation of the view definition

Filtering is only partially supported. A search domain can be used in the
view, but it must be simple (a flat list of conditions without boolean
operators).
